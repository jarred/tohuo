# TOHUTŌ (macron)

An aid to my learning of te reo Māori.

The action of entering words into a programmatic grammar _should_ help with my recollection, and also my overall understanding of how the language is structured. Hopefully I can create a tool to celebrate the beautiful metaphors inherit in the structure of the language that will help others learn also.
